Ade
- Not necessary to ask vehicle type
- Not necessary to define vehicle class -> no vehicle information we want to store
- We should focus on the Parking Lot App
- Advice: Prepare CLI before start, and choose your most comfortable language
- Performance improvement shouldn't be main focus in LLD, brute force is still tolerable, except interviewer said it's important
- Exit function must be friendly to user input: eg: vehicle ID. Vehicle object is not friendly

Raudi
- Good point on asking entrance gate and exit gate -> Determine
